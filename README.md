# Talescape

Talescape is an innovative platform designed to help readers discover books available in nearby libraries. With Talescape, users can search for books in libraries, view detailed information about the books and libraries, check the distance between their location and the library, and reserve books. The platform also allows users to track book availability and navigate to libraries using Google Maps.

## Key Features:

- **Search Books**: Easily browse books available in nearby libraries.
- **Sorted by Distance**: Libraries are listed based on proximity to your location, with the distance shown.
- **Book Details**: View detailed information about each book, including the author, genre, and price.
- **Reserve Books**: Reserve books that are available in nearby libraries.
- **Add Books to Libraries**: Libraries can add new books or update existing ones in their inventory.
- **Library Management**: Libraries can manage their inventory, including modifying book prices, adding new books, and viewing reserved books.
- **Admin Page**: Admin users can manage books and libraries, add new libraries, and control reserved books.
- **Google Maps Integration**: Navigate to the library's location using Google Maps.

## Technologies Used:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: PHP, MySQL (using phpMyAdmin for database management)
- **Containerization**: Docker (for consistent environment setup)

## How Talescape Works:

1. Open the app and search for the book you want to read.
2. View nearby libraries that have the book available.
3. Reserve the book from the closest library.
4. Use Google Maps to navigate to the library.

## Admin Panel:

The admin panel provides complete management for:

- **Books in libraries** (add, update, or remove books).
- **Prices and availability of books**.
- **Library management** (add, delete, or modify libraries).
- **Reserved books and user activity**.
